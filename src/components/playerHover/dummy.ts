  "In the middle of the forest, a big lion was sleeping under a tree. His tummy went up and down as he snored. The forest was very quiet, and soft sunlight came through the leaves.ttle mouse was looking for food. Suddenly, it saw the big lion. The mouse’s eyes opened wide. “Wow! That’s the biggest animal I’ve ever seen!” it said. The mouse walked closer very quietly. “I want to see him up close,” the mouse thought. But oh no! The mouse stepped on the lion’s paw! The lion’s big eyes opened, and he roared very loudly. “Who woke me up?!” he shouted, his voice rumbling like thunder. The mouse froze. Its little body shook, and it squeaked, “Please don’t eat me! I’m just a tiny mouse. I didn’t mean to wake you up!” The lion stared at the mouse with his sharp teeth showing. “You woke me up! I should eat you!” The mouse begged, “Please don’t eat me! I’m so small, but I promise I will help you one day!” The lion laughed. “You? Help me? That’s so funny!” But after thinking for a moment, the lion stopped growling. “You’re too small to bother with,” he said, and he let the mouse go. The little mouse was so scared, it ran as fast as it could! Its tiny legs went pitter-patter, and its long tail swung behind it. The mouse ran into the grass and didn’t stop until it felt safe again. A few days later, the mouse was walking in the forest. Suddenly, it heard a loud, scary noise. “Roar! Roar!” The mouse’s ears stood up. “What is that sound?” it said quietly. The mouse peeked through some bushes. It saw the big lion again, but something was wrong. The lion was stuck in a big net made of ropes. The ropes were wrapped all around him, and he couldn’t move. The lion tried to pull and pull, but the ropes were too strong. “Help me!” the lion cried. His voice sounded sad and scared. The mouse gasped. “Oh no! The lion is in trouble!” it said. The mouse remembered what it promised. “I told him I would help him. I have to try,” the mouse said. The mouse ran to the lion. “Don’t worry!” it said. “I will help you!” The lion looked at the tiny mouse and sighed. “Little mouse, these ropes are too strong for you,” the lion said. But the mouse didn’t stop. It grabbed the rope with its tiny teeth and started to chew. “I can do this!” the mouse said to itself. The mouse chewed and chewed. The rope started to break. Finally, the mouse gave one last big bite, and snap! The net broke. “You’re free now!” the mouse squeaked happily. The lion stood up and shook off the ropes. He looked at the mouse with a big smile. “You saved me!” the lion said. “Thank you, little friend. I was wrong to laugh at you. Even someone as small as you can do something very big.” The mouse smiled proudly. “I’m happy I could help!” it said. From that day on, the lion and the mouse became best friends. They always remembered how they helped each other.";
